## 📌 Problem Statement  
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, operational costs, and workforce stability. High turnover rates can lead to increased hiring expenses, loss of institutional knowledge, and decreased employee morale. However, many companies struggle to identify the root causes of attrition and dissatisfaction due to a lack of data-driven insights.  

## 📌 Why I Developed This Project  
In today’s fast-paced work environment, **employee attrition and workforce management** are major challenges for HR teams. Many organizations struggle to identify:  
- Why employees leave  
- Which departments face the highest turnover  
- How job satisfaction impacts retention  

Without a **data-driven approach**, decision-making is often **reactive rather than proactive**.  

I developed this **HR Analytics Dashboard** to bridge this gap by providing **clear, interactive, and actionable insights** into workforce trends. This project helps HR professionals:  

✅ **Understand attrition patterns** across departments, age groups, and education levels.  
✅ **Analyze job satisfaction trends** to improve employee engagement.
