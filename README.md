# HR-Analytics-PowerBI-Project

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, operational costs, and workforce stability. High turnover rates can lead to increased hiring expenses, loss of institutional knowledge, and decreased employee morale. However, many companies struggle to identify the root causes of attrition and dissatisfaction due to a lack of data-driven insights.

<h2>📌Why I Developed This Project</h2>
In today’s fast-paced work environment, employee attrition and workforce management are major challenges for HR teams. Many organizations struggle to identify why employees leave, which departments face the highest turnover, and how job satisfaction impacts retention. Without a data-driven approach, decision-making is often reactive rather than proactive.

I developed this HR Analytics Dashboard to bridge this gap by providing clear, interactive, and actionable insights into workforce trends. This project helps HR professionals:
- Understand attrition patterns across departments, age groups, and education levels.
- Analyze job satisfaction trends to improve employee engagement.
- Make informed decisions on retention strategies using real-time data.
- Identify risk areas early and take proactive measures to reduce turnover.

By leveraging data visualization, this dashboard enables HR teams to move beyond guesswork and implement strategies that enhance employee retention, productivity, and overall organizational health.
